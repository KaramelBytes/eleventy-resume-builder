{#
  Partial: Structured Data (JSON-LD)
  Path: src/_includes/structured-data.njk
  Description: 
    Outputs JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) structured data, 
    which helps search engines understand the content and context of the page.
    This aids in richer search results (e.g., knowledge panels, rich snippets).
  Schema: Uses Schema.org vocabulary, specifically the "Person" type for a personal resume/portfolio.
  Customization: Most values are currently hardcoded for this specific portfolio. 
                 For broader use, these should be populated dynamically using Eleventy global data or page-specific data.
                 Example: `"url": "{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}"`
